///         existing primitives instead of inventing new trust machinery:
///
///         - **AgentBond (enforcer pattern):** at `create`, a slice of the verifier's posted
///           bond is locked behind the commitment (`lock`, creditor = this contract). On a
///           clean outcome the slice is `release`d; on a liveness failure or an overturned
///           false verdict it is `slash`ed to this contract and routed by the §7a rule: the
///           wronged party receives only `damage`, the surplus is BURNED. CommitStakeV2 writes
///           zero new custody/slashing logic — it drives AgentBond's audited lifecycle.
///         - **StreamPay (fee gating):** the verifier's fee is a stream this contract opens at
///           `create` (sender = this contract, funded by the staker). Accrual gating is
///           *timing-based* (the stream must start at or after the latest possible
///           challenge-window close); on a slash branch the stream is cancelled ATOMICALLY in
///           the same transaction — holding the sender-right is what makes that possible.
///
///         The verifier's two failure modes are handled by exactly the mechanism each supports:
///
///         - **Liveness (provable on-chain):** silence past the deadline slashes the verifier's
///           slice: the staker receives `damage` (the fee actually accrued to the no-show
///           verifier; the arbiter cost is zero on this branch), the surplus is burned, and the
///           stake is returned to the staker. Trustless.
///         - **Correctness (NOT provable on-chain):** a resolved verdict opens a challenge
///           window. Only the party harmed by *this* verdict may challenge, posting a bond.
///           The dispute routes to a single arbiter named at `create` — the explicit,
///           pre-agreed root of trust. The arbiter is paid a fixed fee out of the challenge
///           bond on BOTH rulings (the fact of ruling pays, not the direction); its silence
///           fails closed (verdict stands, bond returned, arbiter unpaid). The arbiter is NOT
///           bonded or slashed by this contract, and it never sets a damage number — it rules
///           pass/fail only.
///
///         **§7a deterministic slash routing (the anti-raid core):** on every slash,
///
///             damage  =  feeAccruedToLyingVerifier  +  challengerArbiterFeeCost
///
///         where `feeAccruedToLyingVerifier` is read from StreamPay's own on-chain state at the
///         moment of the slash (NEVER a caller-supplied number — a caller value would let the
///         lying party or the challenger inject a fake damage), and the challenger's arbiter
///         fee cost is the fee actually carved from its bond. The wronged party receives only
///         `damage`; the surplus `slice − damage` is transferred to the burn address
///         (`0x…dEaD`) — deterministic and owned by no one, never a treasury. This collapses
///         the staker≡beneficiary raid's upside from the whole slice to ≈ pennies, making the
