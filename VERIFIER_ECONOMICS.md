# Verifier Economics (CommitStake v2)

**Status: FINALIZED SPEC (all design forks + cold-economic-review fixes incorporated) , 
owner's pre-contract sight-check pending; no contract deployed yet.** This document is the
authoritative mechanism specification the implementation must match.

CommitStake v1 makes the *staker* accountable: lock USDC behind a goal, a verifier
judges it, the stake is reclaimed on success or slashed to a beneficiary on failure.
The verifier itself is **trusted and unaccountable**, it can stay silent, or lie, at
no cost. v2 closes that gap by giving the verifier *skin in the game*, reusing the two
primitives the stack already ships (AgentBond, StreamPay) rather than inventing new
trust machinery.

The central discipline of this document, carried over from the Phase 1 audit standard
,  is **intellectual honesty about where trust lives**. We do **not** claim the chain can
detect a lie. We split the verifier's two failure modes, enforce the one the chain *can*
prove, and name explicitly the root of trust for the one it cannot.

---

## 1. The two failure modes (the spine)

| | What the verifier does wrong | On-chain provable? | How v2 handles it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Liveness** | Never resolves before the deadline | **Yes**, deadline passed, no `resolve` call | Trustless. Verifier's bonded slice is slashed (**`damage` → staker, surplus → burn**, §7a); **the staker is made whole** (stake returned + accrued-fee damage). |
| **Correctness** | Resolves, but lies (false `pass` / false `fail`) | **No**, the chain cannot know the off-chain truth | Bounded: a two-sided challenge routes to a **named, pre-agreed arbiter** the staker opts into at entry. |

Everything below follows from this split. Most "agent reputation / slashing" designs
blur it and implicitly pretend the chain detects lies. We refuse that.

---

## 2. The bug fix (liveness inversion)

v1 has a genuine injustice. `slashExpired` (CommitStake.sol:158) lets *anyone* push the
stake to the beneficiary once the deadline passes with no resolution. That punishes the
**staker** for the **verifier's** no-show, the staker loses the stake because the judge
never showed up.

v2 inverts it:

- On verifier silence past the deadline, the **verifier's bonded slice is slashed** (the
  at-fault party pays): the staker receives **`damage`** (the fee that accrued to the
  no-show verifier before the atomic cancel; the arbiter cost is zero on this branch) and
  the **surplus is burned** (§7a), and **the staker's stake is returned**, not handed to
  the beneficiary.
- This is a strictly better mechanism *and* it is fully on-chain provable (no oracle, no
  arbiter). It is the clean negative branch we seed first.

We present this in the submission narrative as a **fix**, not a feature: v1 mispriced who
bears the cost of a liveness failure; v2 prices it to the party that caused it.

## 3. State machine, the verdict is never instantly final

A challenge can only unwind a verdict if money has not already moved. So payouts are
gated behind a new finalize step.

                                slashed (anti-grief)
```

**No stake, fee, or bond moves before `finalize` (or a terminal arbiter outcome).** The
challenge window is configurable (minutes for the demo, hours in production) but it always
exists, otherwise the challenge arm is paper.

---

## 4. The bonded verifier, reuse AgentBond, write no new slashing code

v2's CommitStake is an **AgentBond enforcer**. It writes *zero* new custody/slashing
logic; it drives the audited AgentBond obligation lifecycle. This is itself the
composability proof: CommitStake v2 is built **on** AgentBond, not beside it.

Lifecycle, mapped to the real AgentBond surface (`agent-bond/src/AgentBond.sol`):

1. **Opt-in (verifier, once):** `agentBond.setSlashAllowance(commitStakeV2, capacity)` , 
   the verifier grants CommitStake v2 a revolving slashing capacity, exactly like an
   ERC-20 approve.
2. **Lock (at `create`):** CommitStake calls
   `agentBond.lock(verifier, creditor = address(this), slice, bondDeadline)`. This pulls
   `slice` from the verifier's **free** bond. AgentBond already reverts with
   `INSUFFICIENT_BOND` if the verifier doesn't have the free capacity, so a verifier
   **cannot take on more commitments than its free bond covers.** Hit-and-run (many
   commitments, one bond) is structurally impossible, not merely discouraged.
3. **Resolve (clean path):** on a finalized, unchallenged-or-upheld verdict, CommitStake
   calls `agentBond.release(id)`, the slice returns to the verifier's free bond and the
   revolving capacity is restored.
4. **Slash (bad path):** on liveness failure or an overturned false verdict, CommitStake
   calls `agentBond.slash(id)`. AgentBond pays the slice to `creditor` (= CommitStake), which
   forwards only **`damage`** to the wronged party determined at finalize (staker for liveness /
   false-fail; beneficiary for false-pass) and **burns the surplus** (§7a). The arbiter never
   sets that number, it rules pass/fail only.

**Why `creditor = address(this)` (CommitStake), not a fixed party:** the wronged party
isn't known at lock time (a false `fail` harms the staker; a false `pass` harms the
beneficiary). AgentBond fixes the creditor at `lock`. So CommitStake takes custody of the
slashed slice and routes it at finalize. Funds are real (balance-delta), simply forwarded.

**Sizing rule, the central formula of this document.** The slice must make a lie a loss,
not merely a reputational hit. Two bounds, stated honestly:

```
   probabilistic (the real bound):  P(overturn) × slice   >   maxAccruableFee
   single-shot floor (P=1, conservative):  slice  >  stake + maxAccruableFee + arbiterFee + ε
   default:                                 slice  =  150% × stake          (round UP)
   large-fee guard: if maxAccruableFee ≥ 50% × stake, raise slice to
                                            > stake + maxAccruableFee + arbiterFee + ε
```

The `arbiterFee` term is **not optional padding**, it is what keeps the §7a `damage` strictly
below the slice (`damage = feeAccruedToLyingVerifier + arbiterFee ≤ maxAccruableFee + arbiterFee
< slice`), so the surplus burned on every slash is strictly positive. Without it, an
`arbiterFee` chosen up to the slice would let `damage` reach the whole slice and a colluding
arbiter would recapture it, see §9. **Enforced in code** as
`require(verifierSlice > amount + feeDeposit + arbiterFee, "SLICE_TOO_SMALL")` at `create`.

The **single-shot floor** assumes the lie is always caught and overturned (`P(overturn)=1`):
under it, lying is a net loss in one play. But `P(overturn)` is **not observable on-chain**,
and for subjective goals it is well below 1, so the honest bound is the **probabilistic**
one, and where it cannot be met in a single play the incentive is carried by the **repeated
game** (accumulating bond-reputation and future commissions), not by a one-shot guarantee.
This is stated plainly in Trust assumptions (§9), the claim is sized to the evidence.

`ε` covers fee-accrual rounding (StreamPay accrues by wall-clock, floored) and the verifier's
gas; `slice` is always rounded **up**, so the inequality is never satisfied only to a dust unit.

AgentBond enforces the rest for free: `lock` reverts with `INSUFFICIENT_BOND` if the
verifier lacks that much **free** bond, so a verifier can never be on the hook for more
commitments than its posted bond covers. Hit-and-run is structurally impossible.

**`bondDeadline`:** set to the commitment finalize-deadline **plus a buffer**. In the
normal flow CommitStake always resolves the obligation (release or slash) first. The
AgentBond deadline is only a backstop: if CommitStake itself were abandoned/buggy, the
verifier could eventually self-`release` and not be held hostage. Normal flow always wins.

---

## 5. The challenge, two-sided, harmed-party-only, bonded

- **Who may challenge:** only the party harmed by *this* verdict.
  - `fail` verdict → only the **staker** may challenge (it claims the goal *was* met).
  - `pass` verdict → only the **beneficiary** may challenge (it claims the goal was *not* met).
  - Enforced with `require(msg.sender == harmedParty)`. No open challenge right, that
    would invite spam even with a bond.
- **Challenge bond:** the challenger posts a bond up front. On a frivolous challenge
  (arbiter upholds the verifier) the challenger's bond is slashed, anti-grief.

---

## 6. The arbiter, paid for *deciding*, not for the direction; silence has a default

The challenge routes to a single **arbiter named at `create`** and knowingly accepted by
the staker when it opts into the commitment.

- **Motivation:** the arbiter is paid a **fixed fee out of the challenge bond on *both*
  outcomes** (overturn and uphold). The *fact* of ruling pays, not the direction, so the
  arbiter has no incentive to lean either way, and the challenge arm doesn't reproduce the
  liveness problem one level up (an unpaid judge doesn't judge).
- **Arbiter silence (deterministic default):** if the arbiter does not rule by its own
  deadline, the challenge **fails closed**: the original verdict stands, the challenger's
  bond is **returned** (not slashed, it wasn't proven frivolous), and the arbiter is **not
  paid**. *No ruling, no punishment, nobody profits from the deadlock.*
- **Conflict-of-interest, enforced in code (not just documented):** at `create`,
  `require(arbiter != verifier)` and `require(arbiter != staker && arbiter != beneficiary)`.
  The staker-side check is only watertight because **`staker = msg.sender` at `create`**
  (decided, see Appendix): the commitment is always created by the staker itself, so
  `arbiter != msg.sender` *is* the staker conflict check, and no third party can bind an
  unwilling staker into a commitment (the unsolicited-bind surface is closed at the same time).

**The arbiter is NOT bonded or slashed by CommitStake v2 (decided).** Bonding the arbiter
would be theater unless something could slash it, and slashing the arbiter would require
*another* judge above it, the infinite regress we are deliberately terminating. The arbiter
is the explicit, named **root of trust**: accountable by reputation and by being chosen up
front, paid for ruling, defaulting closed on silence.

This does *not* break the stack's reputation thesis, it completes it. An arbiter **may**
voluntarily hold an AgentBond bond as a pure **reputational signal** (its free bond is the
credit score anyone can read before naming it), exactly the primitive's intended use. But
CommitStake v2 **never locks or slashes the arbiter's bond**, the bond, if present, is a
public signal, not a contract-enforced stake. We state this explicitly so the narrative
stays whole without manufacturing a false constraint.

---

## 7. The fee, StreamPay composability

The verifier earns a verification fee streamed via StreamPay (`stream-pay/src/StreamPay.sol`),
the same primitive demonstrated as Stream #18 in Phase 1.

- The fee stream (staker-funded, paid to the verifier) is gated so the verifier is paid only
  for a verdict that survives to finalize: **CommitStake opens the stream itself at `create`
  and is therefore the stream `sender`; on every slash path the terminal call cancels the
  stream atomically**, the unstreamed remainder is refunded to the escrow and forwarded to
  the staker in the same transaction; the verifier keeps only what had already accrued. No
  branch depends on the staker remembering to act.
- **Liveness branch (no-show = no fee):** if the verifier never resolves, `slashVerifierExpired`
  **itself cancels the fee stream atomically** (the contract does not rely on the staker to
  remember). A verifier that does no work earns nothing. *(Spec gap closed, was unspecified.)*

**Decided: StreamPay-native, timing-based gating (option a).** The in-contract escrow
alternative would duplicate escrow logic and pull StreamPay out of the loop, weakening the
very composability thesis.

> **Honest caveat (also in Trust assumptions):** StreamPay accrues by **wall-clock**, not by
> an external event, accrual cannot be made literally conditional on `finalize`. We
> approximate "fee contingent on finalize" by setting the fee-stream window to begin at/after
> the challenge window and cancelling on a slash. This is *timing-based* gating, not
> contract-enforced conditional withdrawal.

**Why the caveat does not hurt, it is a sizing input, not a weakness.** A lying verifier
walks away with *at most* the fee accrued before the terminal call cancels the stream
atomically, while it **loses its entire bonded slice**. That `maxAccruableFee` is exactly the quantity folded into the
slashing bound of §4 (`P(overturn) × slice > maxAccruableFee`), so the timing approximation
is priced into the sizing rule rather than left as a loose end.

---

## 7a. Where the money goes, deterministic routing

Every terminal outcome routes funds by a fixed, on-chain rule (no discretion):

| Outcome | Stake | Slashed verifier slice | Challenge bond |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Clean pass** (no challenge / upheld pass) | → staker (claim) | released to verifier | n/a |
| **Clean fail** (no challenge / upheld fail) | → beneficiary | released to verifier | n/a |
| **Liveness** (silence past deadline) | **returned to staker** | harmed party (staker) gets **`damage`** (fee accrued to the no-show verifier; arbiter cost is zero on this branch); **surplus → BURN** | n/a |
| **False `fail` overturned** | → staker (corrected verdict) | harmed party (staker) gets **`damage`** (formula below); **surplus `slice − damage` → BURN** | refunded to challenger |
| **False `pass` overturned** | → beneficiary (corrected verdict) | harmed party (beneficiary) gets **`damage`**; **surplus → BURN** | refunded to challenger |
| **Frivolous challenge** (verdict upheld) | per the upheld verdict | released to verifier | challenger bond slashed → arbiter fee, remainder (fee-scale at the corrected floor below, pennies) to the (honest) verifier |

Rules behind the table:

- **`damage` is a formula, not a judgement, the arbiter rules only pass/fail, never a number.**
  On an overturn the corrected verdict *already* redirects the stake to the right party, so the
  only residual loss to compensate is narrow and mechanical:

  ```
  damage  =  feeAccruedToLyingVerifier  +  challengerArbiterFeeCost
  ```

  i.e. the fee the lying verifier managed to pull before being slashed, plus the arbiter fee the
  challenger had to spend to get the overturn. Both are on-chain-known quantities. Everything
  above that, the bulk of a slice sized at ≥150% of stake, is **surplus that is burned.** The
  arbiter's authority never expands to setting damages.

  **`damage < slice` is guaranteed, not assumed.** Both terms are bounded by create-time inputs:
  `feeAccruedToLyingVerifier ≤ feeDeposit` and `challengerArbiterFeeCost ≤ arbiterFee`. The
  sizing rule `verifierSlice > amount + feeDeposit + arbiterFee` (enforced at `create`) therefore
  forces `damage < slice` on **every** slash branch, so the burned surplus `slice − damage` is
  **strictly positive**, the §7a defense can never be zeroed out by an inflated `arbiterFee`.
  (This closes a gate-4 audit finding: before `arbiterFee` was folded into the sizing rule, an
  `arbiterFee ≥ slice` made `damage ≥ slice`, burning nothing and letting a colluding arbiter
  recapture the whole slice.)

- **Surplus → BURN, never a treasury.** The surplus goes to a dead address
  (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`), deterministic and owned by no one. A treasury
  would imply a recipient and a decision-maker, breaking the **ownerless, no-admin-keys** thesis,
  and creating a honeypot plus a governance burden. Burning keeps the contract trustless.

- **Why this defangs the raid (G1):** with the harmed party capped at `damage` (pennies) and the
  rest burned, a `staker≡beneficiary` attacker that challenges an honest `pass` *no longer wins
  the slice on an arbiter error*, its upside collapses to ~`damage` while it risks a
  slice-denominated challenge bond. The attack goes from +EV to deeply −EV.

- **Arbiter fee** is taken from the **challenge bond on both rulings** (the fact of ruling pays).
  The challenge bond must therefore be `≥ arbiterFee`.
- **Arbiter silence** → challenge fails closed: verdict stands, challenge bond **returned** to
  challenger, arbiter unpaid. Nobody profits from the deadlock. (Why fail-closed, not slice-to-
  challenger: see §9, slashing the verifier for the *arbiter's* inaction would repeat, one level
  up, the very V1 injustice we fixed.)

**The challenge bond is sized against the *post-burn* capturable prize, not the stake, and
not the slice.** Two earlier rules were wrong, in opposite directions:

- The original `≥25–50% × stake` floor priced the bond against the base while the prize on an
  erroneous overturn was the **slice**. This was a live finding, not a theoretical one: with
  the bond at `0.25–0.5 × stake` and the slice at `1.5 × stake`, a `staker≡beneficiary`
  attacker (whose stake leg nets to zero) broke even at an arbiter error rate of only
  **≈17%**, the prize was extractable. That finding is what the **surplus-burn** above fixes.
- The interim `arbiterFee + k × slice (k ≥ 1)` floor over-corrected: it kept pricing the bond
  against the **pre-burn** prize even though the burn had already collapsed the capturable
  upside to `damage` (≈ pennies). The two fixes closed the same hole twice, and the bill
  landed on the **legitimate** challenger: a victim of a false `fail` would have risked a
  ~1.5×-stake bond to recover a ~1×-stake claim, which is negative-EV whenever
  `P(overturn)` is below ~60%. For exactly the subjective goals where challenges matter most,
  the rational harmed party would never challenge, the challenge arm would be paper.

With the prize already removed by the burn, the bond only needs to cover what a frivolous
challenge *costs the system*, the arbiter's fee plus a spam margin:

```
   challengeBond × P(uphold)  >  capturable upside on an erroneous overturn  =  damage (≈ pennies)
   hard floor:   challengeBond  ≥  arbiterFee + spamMargin
                 spamMargin  ≤  0.1–0.25 × slice        (small k, NOT k ≥ 1)
```

Sized this way the legitimate harmed party risks a fee-scale bond to recover a stake-scale
loss, challenging is rational whenever the claim is genuine, while a frivolous or colluding
challenger still pays the arbiter and forfeits its margin to win, at most, `damage`. A side
effect: the frivolous-branch "remainder → honest verifier" payout (table above) shrinks to
pennies, so the verifier has no incentive to *provoke* challenges either. The mirror case
(staker frivolously challenging a `fail`) is bounded identically. `challengeBond` is a
first-class create-parameter, and the band is enforced in code as floor **and** cap:
`BOND_BELOW_FLOOR` rejects an undersized bond, `BOND_ABOVE_CAP` an oversized one, so the
legitimate harmed party can never be priced out of challenging by an inflated bond, and the
upper `0.1–0.25 × slice` margin is a contract constraint, not just a sizing guideline.

## 8. On-chain seed plan (real Arc testnet tx, including a negative branch)

1. **Positive:** verifier resolves correctly, no challenge → at finalize the stake settles
   per verdict, `agentBond.release` returns the slice, fee stream settles.
2. **Negative 1 (liveness):** verifier stays silent past the deadline → `slashVerifierExpired`
   cancels the fee stream, `agentBond.slash` sends `damage` → staker, **stake returned to
   staker**, surplus burned (the bug-fix branch).
3. **Negative 2 (correctness):** verifier issues a false `fail`, staker challenges, arbiter
   overturns → `agentBond.slash`; staker compensated `damage`, **surplus → burn**, challenge
   bond refunded.

All three categorised with tx hashes, as in Phase 1.

---

## 9. Trust assumptions (explicit, claim sized to evidence)

- **Liveness arm: trustless.** "Verifier resolved before the deadline" is on-chain
  observable. Silence slashes the verifier and returns the stake with no oracle, no arbiter.
- **Correctness arm: rooted in a named, pre-agreed arbiter.** The chain cannot know whether
  the off-chain goal was met. The arbiter is the explicit root of trust, named at `create`,
  knowingly accepted by the staker on entry. It is **paid for ruling, not slashed**; its
  silence fails closed. An arbiter may hold an AgentBond bond as a public reputational signal,
  but v2 never locks or slashes it.
- **Economic backstop on the verifier, and where it is *probabilistic*, not absolute.**
  The verifier's incentive is independently aligned: with the slashing bound of §4 a lie is
  loss-making. But honesty is provably dominant in a **single play** only when the lie is
  certain to be overturned (`P(overturn)=1`). `P(overturn)` is **not on-chain observable**, and
  for **subjective goals it is below 1**, so in the one-shot game honesty is *not* guaranteed
  dominant there. The incentive in that regime is carried by the **repeated game**: the verifier's
  accumulating bond-reputation (its free bond is the public credit score) and the flow of future
  commissions it would forfeit. We say this plainly: the claim is sized to the evidence, and the
  one-shot subjective-goal case rests on reputation, not on a per-event proof.
- **What is NOT protected** (stated, not hidden):
  - **Arbiter dishonesty / beneficiary–arbiter collusion.** A corrupt arbiter (or one
    colluding with the party it should rule against) can mis-rule. Mitigations are economic
    and reputational (the arbiter is public and chosen up front), not cryptographic. *(The
    surplus-burn of §7a **caps** how much such collusion can extract to `damage`: the sizing rule
    `slice > stake + maxAccruableFee + arbiterFee` keeps `damage < slice`, so on any mis-rule the
    harmed/colluding party receives at most `damage` and the strictly-positive surplus
    `slice − damage` is burned. The cap is real, not incidental, but it does not stop a mis-rule
    from happening, so the hole is bounded, not closed.)*
  - **Arbiter liveness is part of the trust root, by design.** A challenged dispute fails closed
    if the arbiter stays silent (§6, §7a). We deliberately do **not** slash the verifier for the
    arbiter's inaction: the verifier did not choose the arbiter, the **staker** did at `create`.
    Slashing it for a third party's silence would repeat, one level up, the exact V1 injustice we
    fixed (punishing one party for another's no-show), and would let a challenger weaponise a
    bribed-silent arbiter into an automatic win. So the arbiter's reliability, its honesty *and*
    its liveness, is the content of the named trust root the staker accepts on entry.
    **Choosing a diligent arbiter is the staker's responsibility.** The arbiter is paid only on a
    ruling, so silence is its loss too.
  - **Subjective / borderline goals.** "Did the agent write *good* code?" has no objective
    on-chain answer; the arbiter's judgement is final by construction.
  - **Fee gating is timing-based** (§7 caveat), not a hard on-chain condition.

We make exactly the claims the mechanism supports, and no more.

---

## 10. Scope & fallback (risk rule)

The liveness inversion (§2) is **independently complete and valuable**, it is fully
trustless and fixes a real v1 injustice on its own.

If the challenge/arbiter arm's design or on-chain seeding slips, we ship **only** the
liveness arm (the Phase-1-approved "Option A") cleanly, rather than leaving a half-wired
challenge path. No half-finished branch ever ships.

Phase 1 QC discipline repeats at the end of Phase 2: an **independent adversarial Forge
audit** (fresh spawn, cold read) against the new contract logic before it is called done.

**Decided parameters (all forks closed):**
- Arbiter: **unbonded, not slashed** (§6); may hold a bond as a pure reputational signal only.
- Fee gating: **StreamPay-native, timing-based** (§7); liveness branch cancels the stream atomically.
- `verifierSlice` default: **150% × stake** (round up, +ε), raised per the §4 large-fee guard.
  Honest slashing bound is **probabilistic**: `P(overturn) × slice > maxAccruableFee` (§4, §9).
  **Hard create-time floor (enforced): `verifierSlice > amount + feeDeposit + arbiterFee`**, this
  keeps the §7a `damage` strictly below the slice so the surplus burned is always positive and a
  colluding arbiter cannot recapture the slice via an inflated `arbiterFee` (§4, §7a, §9).
- `challengeWindow` and the arbiter-decision deadline: **3–5 minutes for the demo seed**, both
  **create-parameters** (not constants) so production can set hours.
- `challengeBond`: **create-parameter**, floored at **`arbiterFee + spamMargin`** with
  `spamMargin ≤ 0.1–0.25 × slice`, sized against the **post-burn** capturable prize
  (`damage`, ≈ pennies), not the slice, so the legitimate harmed party is never priced out
  of challenging (§7a corrected bound).
- Slashed-slice routing: harmed party gets **`damage = feeAccruedToLyingVerifier +
  challengerArbiterFeeCost`**; **surplus → `0x…dEaD` burn**. Arbiter rules pass/fail only (§7a).
- **G8 default:** arbiter silence **fails closed** (verdict stands, bond returned), never slash
  the verifier for the arbiter's inaction (§9 reasoning).
- **`staker = msg.sender` at `create`**, the commitment is always created by the staker; no
  `staker` parameter exists, so the `arbiter != msg.sender` check covers the staker conflict
  (§6) and the unsolicited-bind surface is closed (§6, Appendix).
