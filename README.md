# Arc Agentic Stack

[![tests](https://github.com/Mnorbert87/arc-agentic-stack/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mnorbert87/arc-agentic-stack/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**Trust + settlement primitives for autonomous agents — settled in USDC on Arc.**

Submitted to the Circle *Stablecoin Commerce Stack Challenge* — **Track 4: Best Agentic Economy Experience on Arc.**

Every "agentic" demo quietly assumes two things that don't actually exist on-chain yet: that you can **trust an agent before it touches your money**, and that you can **pay it continuously as it works** instead of after the fact. The Arc Agentic Stack ships both as small, composable, ownerless contracts.

| | Layer | Contract | What it answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ | **Trust** | [`AgentBond`](#agentbond--trust-layer) | *"Can I trust this agent before it acts?"* |
| 💧 | **Settlement** | [`StreamPay`](#streampay--settlement-layer) | *"Can I pay it per second of work, not per invoice?"* |
| 🔥 | **Mechanism** | [`CommitStakeV2`](#commitstakev2--who-pays-when-the-verifier-lies) | *"Who pays when the verifier lies?"* |

The two primitives each work standalone. `CommitStakeV2` composes both into a complete, ownerless
trust-and-pay rail for autonomous agents.

## Architecture

![Architecture](architecture.png)

An autonomous agent lifecycle, settled end-to-end in USDC:

1. **Bond up** — the agent deposits USDC into `AgentBond`. Its *free* bond becomes a public, slashable credit score. *(AgentBond)*
2. **Get hired** — a counterparty reads the bond and decides the agent is trustworthy enough for the job. *(off-chain)*
3. **Lock collateral** — an agent-authorized *enforcer* locks a slice of the agent's bond behind the job as an *obligation*, payable to the counterparty if defaulted. *(AgentBond)*
4. **Stream pay** — it opens a `StreamPay` stream; the agent earns USDC by the second as it works. *(StreamPay)*
5. **Settle** — performed → bond released & stream withdrawn; defaulted → bond slashed to the creditor, stream cancelled. *(both)*

Both contracts are **ownerless** — no admin, no upgrade key — and track balances by **real balance delta**, so they stay solvent against any token and can't be rugged by privileged roles.

### AgentBond — trust layer

A reputation deposit that behaves like an ERC-20 allowance system for *slashing*:

- `deposit(amount)` / `withdraw(amount)` — manage your bond. *Free* bond = total − locked.
- `setSlashAllowance(enforcer, amount)` — authorize a specific protocol to lock & slash up to `amount`. Set `0` to revoke.
- `lock(agent, creditor, amount, deadline) → id` — an enforcer locks a slice of an agent's bond behind an obligation (spends the allowance). `deadline` (unix seconds, `0` = none) lets the agent self-release if the enforcer goes silent.
- `release(id)` — obligation settled; capacity revolves back to free bond. Callable by the enforcer any time, or by the **agent** after a non-zero `deadline` passes (anti-griefing — no enforcer can lock a bond forever).
- `slash(id)` — agent defaulted; the bond pays the creditor, that capacity is burned.

### StreamPay — settlement layer

Linear, per-second USDC accrual — the right shape for continuous agent work:

- `createStream(recipient, deposit, start, stop, memo) → id` — escrow USDC that vests linearly between `start` and `stop`.
- `balanceOf(id)` — how much has vested to the recipient right now.
- `withdraw(id, amount)` — recipient pulls vested funds at any moment.
- `cancel(id)` — split the stream at "now": recipient keeps the vested part, sender reclaims the rest.

Concrete fits from the Track 4 brief: **pay-per-inference agents**, **per-API-call billing**, and **per-second / streaming subscriptions**.

## CommitStakeV2 — who pays when the verifier lies?

The two primitives answer *"can I trust the agent?"* and *"can I pay it continuously?"*. They leave one
question open: when a **verifier** vouches for an agent's work and is wrong — by laziness or by
collusion — who eats the cost? `CommitStakeV2` is the mechanism that answers it, and it writes **zero
new custody code**: it drives `AgentBond`'s slash allowance and opens a `StreamPay` fee stream itself.
It is the composability thesis made executable — a mechanism built *on* the two primitives, not beside them.

Three claims, each backed by something you can re-run:

1. **Bonded verifier, recursive trust.** The verifier posts its own `AgentBond` bond and grants
   CommitStakeV2 a revocable slash allowance. Trusting the agent's result reduces to trusting a party
   with skin in the game — and that skin is enforced on-chain, not promised.
2. **The raid finding, closed by full accounting — not patched over.** A 4th-gate cold adversarial
   audit found that an uncapped `arbiterFee` could feed `damage` until it equalled the slice, zeroing
   the §7a **surplus-burn** — the anti-collusion device at the core of the mechanism. The fix folds
   `arbiterFee` into the slice-sizing rule so `surplus = slice − damage` stays **strictly positive**
   by construction: a colluding arbiter can never recapture the slice. Found by counting it through,
   closed by counting it through. ([TEST_AUDIT.md](./contracts/commit-stake-v2/TEST_AUDIT.md))
3. **Symbolically-verified surplus-burn, proven live.** Halmos proves solvency, surplus-positivity,
   no-double-pay and the fee-residue bound **for all inputs**; two on-chain artifacts show the burn
   actually happening: an overturn burn of **1.45 USDC**
   ([tx](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x97f31e7a590af4ecc2f88c8f34943fe95be41391c9c3a4e3895d9a3d13c45435))
   and a liveness burn of the **whole 1.50 USDC slice**
   ([tx](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x7bf59845abadf3847061b5997e96e303a959d722c8a7283b160b3c82b14aa6bd))
   to `0x…dEaD`.

The spec ([VERIFIER_ECONOMICS.md](./VERIFIER_ECONOMICS.md)) was already public; with this the
**implementation, the source-verified deploy, and a four-layer audit trail now sit in one repo beside it**:

| Layer | Document | What it proves |
|---|---|---|

## Design FAQ — anticipated questions

**Who can slash a bond? Can a counterparty just take the money and run?**
No. A creditor *cannot* slash — they are only the address a slash pays out to. Slashing is gated to a single `enforcer` contract that **the agent itself authorized** via `setSlashAllowance(enforcer, amount)`, capped at a chosen amount and revocable to `0` at any time (`slash` requires `msg.sender == enforcer`). And if that enforcer goes silent, a non-zero `deadline` lets the **agent** self-`release` and reclaim its bond — so no one can lock collateral forever. Dispute resolution is deliberately *not* hardcoded: the enforcer is pluggable (a co-signed attestation, a multisig, an optimistic oracle, a Kleros-style court). `AgentBond` ships the slashing *primitive*; the policy is yours to choose. This is the composability thesis, not a missing piece.

**Doesn't per-second streaming + pay-per-call flood the chain with transactions?**
For streaming, no — and it's a common misconception. `StreamPay` does **not** transact per second. A stream is ~2–3 on-chain transactions *total*: one to open, one (or a few) `withdraw`s whenever the recipient chooses, and an optional `cancel`. Accrual is a pure `view` computation (`deposit × elapsed ÷ duration`) — zero transactions while it runs, whether the stream lasts a minute or a month. Pay-per-call (x402) *is* one transaction per paid call by design; that high-frequency path is exactly what Arc's USDC-denominated, fast-finality settlement is built for, and it composes with `StreamPay` so repeated calls to one provider can settle as a single stream instead of N discrete payments.

**Does the bond punish an agent for an honest LLM mistake, not just malice?**
Yes — by design, because on-chain you can only verify *outcomes*, not *intent*. A bond is an SLA, not a morality test: a contractor who underdelivers through incompetence still forfeits their deposit, same as one who defrauds. Two things soften this in the stack: (1) `StreamPay` makes failure **non-binary** — an agent that fails mid-job has already been paid for the seconds it actually worked; only the remainder is at risk, so a stumble isn't a total loss; and (2) what counts as "performed" is decided at the *enforcer / verification* layer you plug in, not in the bond primitive — so domain-appropriate fairness (retries, partial credit, human review) lives where it belongs. Reliability remains the agent's responsibility: better models, self-checks, or a shared insurance pool.

## Verification — tests, fuzz, invariants, threat model

Every contract in the stack ships with a unit + adversarial + fuzz + **invariant** suite, run on every push by [CI](.github/workflows/test.yml). The invariants are checked against *ghost ledgers built from real ERC-20 balance movements* — the tests never trust the contract's own bookkeeping. Actual numbers from the current suite (forge 1.7.1, same config enforced in CI):

| Project | Tests | Fuzz properties | Invariants | Invariant campaign | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`contracts/agent-bond`](contracts/agent-bond/README.md) | 29 | 5 × 10,000 runs | 4 | each 10,000 runs × depth 15 = 150,000 calls | ✅ 0 failed, 0 violations |
| [`contracts/stream-pay`](contracts/stream-pay/README.md) | 25 | 5 × 10,000 runs | 3 | each 10,000 runs × depth 15 = 150,000 calls | ✅ 0 failed, 0 violations |
| [`contracts/commit-stake`](contracts/commit-stake/README.md) | 25 | 6 × 10,000 runs | 3 | each 10,000 runs × depth 15 = 150,000 calls | ✅ 0 failed, 0 violations |
| [`contracts/commit-stake-v2`](contracts/commit-stake-v2/TEST_AUDIT.md) | 79 | 6 × 10,000 runs | 5 | each 10,000 runs × depth 15 = 150,000 calls | ✅ 0 failed, 0 violations |

`commit-stake-v2` carries three layers the others don't: **6 Halmos symbolic proofs** (all-inputs
solvency / surplus-positivity / no-double-pay), a **Slither + Aderyn** pass with by-design findings
annotated in-source and `--fail-pedantic` in CI, and a **mutation campaign** (100% revert-class kill).
The full trail is in [its audit docs](#commitstakev2--who-pays-when-the-verifier-lies).

Headline invariants (full statements in the per-project READMEs):

- **Solvency** (all three): the contract's real USDC balance always equals observed inflows minus observed outflows — it can never pay out more than was paid in.
- **Bond equation** (AgentBond): `free + locked == deposits − slashed − withdrawn` against an independently observed ghost ledger.
- **Vesting bound** (StreamPay): a recipient's cumulative payout never exceeds the linear vesting cap recomputed from the stream's parameters in the test itself.
- **Exactly-one payout** (CommitStake): every stake reaches the staker XOR the beneficiary — double payout is impossible.

Adversarial analysis — who can attack (malicious verifier, silent verifier, griefing, front-running, reentrancy, insolvency, privileged rug) and the exact mechanism that stops each — is in [**THREAT_MODEL.md**](THREAT_MODEL.md).

## How Circle products are used on Arc

| Product | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **USDC** | The settlement rail for *both* bonds and streams. All value in the stack is USDC. | ✅ Live on testnet |
| **Arc** | Deterministic finality + USDC-denominated fees let an agent budget, pay gas, post bond and settle in one unit. | ✅ Live on testnet |
| **Circle Wallets** | Agent-held key management: the agent (Aiden) signs its Arc transactions through a Circle Developer-Controlled Wallet — no private key on disk ever touches the chain. | ✅ Live on testnet |
| **Nanopayments** | Pattern demonstrated: `x402` charges per API call and `StreamPay` accrues USDC per second — sub-cent, high-frequency USDC settlement on Arc. (We demo the settlement *pattern*; the Circle Nanopayments product itself is not integrated.) | 🧪 Pattern demonstrated |

USDC, Arc and Circle Wallets transact USDC on Arc directly — there is no off-chain ledger or batching intermediary in the trust-and-pay path.

### Circle Wallets — live agent-signed transactions

A Circle Developer-Controlled Wallet (`0xdFDaDEb7440f1CE4Cc2f62Aa21BCCe3374bDF46b`, provisioned on `ARC-TESTNET`) signs a full lifecycle against the live contracts. Circle holds the key; the agent authorizes each call with the registered Entity Secret — so the autonomous agent transacts on Arc without any private key on disk. Verified on testnet:

| Step | Contract call | Tx |
|---|---|---|
| Approve | `USDC.approve(StreamPay)` | [`0x053495…be03`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x05349563271e35e9b79d66116cd5d84ca65cff8032bce41fa937ff29dca8be03) |
| Approve | `USDC.approve(AgentBond)` | [`0xfb90ad…4277`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0xfb90ad375c089cf1db78f59beaf4c5ad9f07958311248c9815b4bb2291c74277) |
| Bond | `AgentBond.deposit(1 USDC)` | [`0x59a8a0…20ab`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x59a8a0d095ca745ee2f37f0abfcdc631852707ced7d8e8a1128ebd42f09220ab) |
| Stream | `StreamPay.createStream(1 USDC / 120s)` | [`0x2f96d1…7302`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x2f96d176d5904278806259cd4b96a38d1f0550e078fc953878028bb7b55d7302) |

Circle's `estimateContractExecutionFee` and `createContractExecutionTransaction` work against Arc's USDC-as-gas model with no special-casing beyond the `ARC-TESTNET` chain identifier.

## Run it locally

### Contracts (Foundry)

```bash
# from each contract dir: contracts/agent-bond, contracts/stream-pay, contracts/commit-stake
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std   # test/script dependency (gitignored)
forge build
forge test                            # full unit + adversarial suites
```

Deploy to Arc Testnet:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...        # a testnet burner with Arc testnet USDC
export RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

### Frontends (static, zero-build)

```bash
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Each frontend is a single `index.html` using `ethers` from a CDN — no install, no bundler, host anywhere static.

### SDK (one-import integration)

For agents and backends, [`sdk/`](./sdk/) is a tiny [ethers v6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)
wrapper with the addresses, chain id, and USDC decimals baked in — so a team integrates the
whole stack in ~10 lines without re-deriving any Arc constants:

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { ArcAgenticStack } from "./sdk/arc-agentic-stack.js";

const agent = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.AGENT_KEY, ArcAgenticStack.provider());
const arc   = new ArcAgenticStack(agent);

await arc.bond("5");                                                       // post 5 USDC of trust
const { id } = await arc.createStream(CLIENT, "2", { durationSeconds: 3600, memo: "api work" });
```

`node sdk/example.js` runs a read-only snapshot against live testnet (no key needed). Full API in
[`sdk/README.md`](./sdk/README.md).

### x402 pay-per-call demo

[`x402-demo/`](./x402-demo/) shows the settlement layer driving a real machine-to-machine
payment: an autonomous buyer agent pays an API **per request** over the
[x402](https://www.x402.org/) pattern (HTTP `402 Payment Required`), with each call settled
**on-chain in USDC on Arc** through StreamPay. The server opens nothing of its own — it
`withdraw()`s the seconds that have vested to it and returns `200` **only after** the on-chain
settlement lands, so the `402 → 200` transition is bound to a live payment.

```bash
cd x402-demo
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # two dedicated burner keys; .env is gitignored, never committed
./run.sh                    # bootstrap → server → buyer agent → tee to demo-run.log
```

A verified end-to-end transcript with live arcscan links (committed 0.30 USDC, paid 0.17 for
three calls, reclaimed 0.13) is in [`x402-demo/SAMPLE_RUN.md`](./x402-demo/SAMPLE_RUN.md).

## Circle Product Feedback

### Why we chose these products

We deliberately built on **USDC + Arc** for the trust path, used **Circle Wallets** so the agent holds its own key, and let the **Nanopayments** pattern fall out naturally — per-call (x402) and per-second (StreamPay) settlement *are* sub-cent, high-frequency USDC transfers on Arc. Arc's *USDC-as-gas* model is what makes an agent economy actually clean: an autonomous agent can hold one balance and use it to pay fees, post collateral, and receive streamed income without ever touching a separate native gas token or an FX hop. That single-unit accounting is the difference between a demo and something an agent could really operate inside.

### What worked well

- **Deterministic, dollar-denominated fees.** Budgeting agent actions in USDC instead of a volatile gas token removed an entire class of "did the tx have enough gas" failure handling from our agent logic.
- **Standard EVM tooling.** Foundry, `ethers`, and MetaMask worked against the Arc Testnet RPC with zero special-casing beyond the chain id (`5042002`) and explorer URL. We shipped two contracts + full adversarial test suites + three frontends with no Arc-specific SDK lock-in.
- **6-decimal ERC-20 USDC** behaved exactly like USDC elsewhere, so our balance-delta accounting (which keeps the contracts solvent and ownerless) needed no Arc-specific adjustments.

### What could be improved

- **The 18-decimal native gas / 6-decimal ERC-20 USDC split is a real footgun.** It's easy to reason about "USDC" as one thing and then off-by-12-decimals yourself when a value crosses between gas and token contexts. A first-class helper or a loud doc callout right at the top of the quickstart would save every team this bug.
- **Testnet faucet throughput** was the main bottleneck for seeding multi-actor demos (agent + enforcer + creditor + stream sender/recipient all need balances). A higher per-request amount or a batch faucet for hackathon accounts would speed up realistic multi-party testing.
- **Explorer indexing lag** on freshly deployed contracts occasionally made verification feel slow; a "pending verification" state would reassure builders that the tx landed.

### Recommendations to make the developer experience more seamless

1. Ship a tiny **`@circle/arc` quickstart** that bakes in chain id, RPC, explorer, USDC address, and the decimal helper — the four things every team re-derives by hand.
2. Provide a **canonical testnet USDC** address in the docs header (we hardcoded ours from on-chain reads; a documented constant removes guesswork).
3. Publish a first-class reference pattern for **agent-held keys via Circle Wallets** signing Arc transactions. We wired this ourselves (see the live-tx table above) and it worked with no Arc-specific special-casing — but it's the missing primitive between "smart contract" and "autonomous agent," so an official, documented pattern would unblock the whole Track 4 category for every team.
